# Writing TODOs

Use this checklist as a living guide while filling the papers.

## Paper PA — User Knowledge Graphs
- [ ] Intro: context and problem paragraphs; finalize contribution bullets.
- [ ] Add RAG vs UKG figure (export to `docs/figures/pa_rag_vs_ukg.pdf`).
- [ ] Related work: expand citations; fill `pa_related_work.tex` with precise comparisons.
- [ ] Method: detail schema attributes; specify update rules and consolidation policy.
- [ ] Experiments: align dataset stats with `data/` assets; update `pa_dataset_stats.tex`.
- [ ] Results: generate groundedness curve and contradictions heatmap.
- [ ] Discussion: connect to cognitive models; enumerate limitations clearly.

## Paper PB — Low-data Fine-tuning
- [ ] Intro: privacy framing and contributions.
- [ ] Add full vs adapters figure (`docs/figures/pb_full_vs_adapters.pdf`).
- [ ] Background: complete technical table `pb_background_tech.tex` with actual numbers per model.
- [ ] Method: formalize metrics (alignment judge, forgetting index formula).
- [ ] Experiments: update `pb_dataset_stats.tex` and model list; add ablation plan.
- [ ] Results: produce performance vs size and alignment/forgetting figures.
- [ ] Discussion: trade-offs and limitations; privacy considerations.
